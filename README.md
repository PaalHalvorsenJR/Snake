Snake Game 

## Description
I have made a snake game written in java. The game is played on a 2D grid. The snake is controlled by the arrow keys. The snake can eat apple and grow in length. On the board there is also rotten apples, if the snake eat these the lengt is degresing and you lose a life. You can eat 3 apples beforeyou die and the game is over. The snake can also die by hitting the walls or itself. The game ends when the snake dies. The score is the length of the snake. The game has also levels and for every 10 apples you will gain a new level. When u enter a new level the speed on the snake is increasing The game can be played by running the SnakeGame.java file.

## How to play
To play the game you have to simply run the "".java file and the game will start. The game is played by using the arrow keys. The arrow keys are used to control the snake. The snake can only move in the direction of the arrow key. The snake can not move backwards. The snake will continue to move in the same direction until a new arrow key is pressed or the snake hits a wall or itself.
